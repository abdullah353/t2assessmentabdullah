Touch again to mark it correct if the child self-corrects.<li>Stay quiet, except when providing answers as follows: if the child hesitates for 3 seconds, provide the sound of the letter, point to the next letter and say <b>“Please go on.”</b>Mark the letter you provide to the child as incorrect.<li>If the student gives you the letter name, rather than the sound, provide the letter sound and say: <b>“Please tell me the SOUND of the letter.”</b>.
